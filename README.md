# Data-Structures-Project-3-Circular-Queue
The third programming assignment for the Data Structures class at Florida Polytechnic University

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to design from scratch a "circular queue" data structure. It initializes an array of a specified capacity, but allows for adding elements to the "rear", removing elements from the "front", and printing elements in the order that they're added.
